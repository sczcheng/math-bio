This is my code for a math bio project. 

For this project, I looked at COVID vaccination rate, immunity loss, vaccination probability fluctuation, and two populations interacting with each other using an SIR model. I expanded on the SIR model presented in Widyaningsih et al. (2018).  

Here are the parameters:

loss, and relapse to study tuberculosis transmission in Indonesia." (2018)._
